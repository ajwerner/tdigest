# tdigest
[![Documentation](https://godoc.org/github.com/ajwerner/tdigest?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/ajwerner/tdigest)

This is a concurrent go implementation of the t-digest data structure
for streaming quantile estimation. The code implements the zero-allocation,
merging algorithm from Ted Dunning's paper ([here][histo.pdf]).

It utilizes the later iteration of the scale functions, currently just exposing
scale function `k_2` from the paper.

The implementation strives to make concurrent writes cheap. In the common case
a write needs only increment an atomic and write two floats to a buffer.
Occasionlly, when the buffer fills, a caller will have to perform the merge
operation.

## TODOs

- [ ] Provide encoding functionality
- [ ] Benchmark against HDR Histogram
- [ ] Evaluate accuracy against HDR Histogram at reasonable settings
- [ ] Implement more scale functions
   - [ ] k_3
   - [ ] k_0 (uniform weight)
- [ ] Describe use cases, comparisons, trade-offs
